/* COPY THE PAGE AS TEXT -- the print menu's and the composer's second output.
 * 🚫 THE REASONING IS NOT HERE. It is specs/print-compose.md §9, rulings C1-C8.
 * This header carries only the rules the code below must obey, and every one of
 * them is here because breaking it already cost a real paste.
 *
 * Michael, 2026-10-03, which is the whole brief: *"i usually just pop into an
 * email and provide the basic starting run sheet that they work from, which they
 * can paste into their own Google Doc."*
 *
 * 🔴 IT IS A CLIPBOARD WRITE, NOT A FILE, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT CHEAP.
 * print-packet.md §5's refusal of a second renderer is untouched: nothing is
 * rendered, nothing hits disk, there is no artifact URL to govern. The payload is
 * pasted TWICE -- into a mail body, then into somebody else's Doc -- so it has to
 * survive both hops.
 *
 * 🔴 THE LEVEL DIAL MAY MOVE FORMATTING AND MAY NEVER MOVE CONTENT.
 * print-control.md §1: *"a print option is safe only if it cannot change what the
 * document says."* That is the only reason a level toggle is allowed here when
 * callout density was REFUSED as a reader control.
 *
 *     rich   semantic HTML -- h1-h6, strong, em, ul/ol, table, blockquote, a.
 *            🚫 NO class, NO style, NO custom property. "Stripped" means the
 *            structure travels and the skin does not.
 *     plain  text only. Tables become LIST MODE, the data.css 640px ruling,
 *            because a pipe table pasted into a Doc is a wall of punctuation.
 *
 * ⭐ THE CALLOUT'S WORD IS OFF THE DIAL AT EVERY LEVEL. Hawthorne's floor, not a
 * preference: print-control.md §1 refuses callout density because it decides
 * *"whether a hazard box still reads as a hazard box."* A red border cannot
 * survive a Google Doc. `DANGER:` can. 🔴 Rich mode strips the class, so the word
 * must be INJECTED or stripping would silently delete the hazard.
 *
 * ✅ SAFETY IS INHERITED, NOT RE-ARGUED. print-compose.md §3: the composer's
 * library is `search/search_index.json`, public pages only -- *"the packet's A7
 * leak fence, for free"* -- and a body still wearing a router curtain is already
 * skipped and named. This module reads only what is already stitched or already
 * on screen, so it cannot widen that fence.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DOCUMENT MUST EXIST AND BE VISIBLE BEFORE IT LEAVES (ruling 6's reason
 * for refusing auto-print: *"the glance at the cover is the last line of
 * defence."*) 🔴 C1 read that as "preview bar only" and was OVER-SCOPED, corrected
 * 2026-10-04 by Michael on first use: *"In the first print menu, I should be able
 * to copy the text. I shouldn't have to go through a whole build of a print packet
 * before I get to that copy text button!"* ⭐ Right, and the clause above is why:
 * on an ordinary page the document already exists and is already visible -- **the
 * page IS its own preview.** So BOTH hosts, and the preview argument still binds
 * where it actually applies: the composer.
 *
 * ⚠️ SIZE. 21KB against a ~22KB read ceiling, and the header has already been cut
 * once to buy room. 🔴 THE NEXT EDIT SPLITS THE CONVERTERS FROM THE UI. There is
 * no third trim left.
 *
 * State: sessionStorage, key `dr-copytext-v1` (ruling 7 shape; dies with the tab).
